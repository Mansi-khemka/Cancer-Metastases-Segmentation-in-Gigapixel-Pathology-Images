# Cancer-Metastases-Segmentation-in-Gigapixel-Pathology-Images
Preprocessed high magnification (1000k X 1000k pixels) images by dividing into patches, filtering tissue concentrated patches, image standardization, pixel normalization and augmentation. Used U-Net and Ensemble Learning based methods to segment tumor regions with up to 70% accuracy.
